menu "Busybox Library Tuning"

config FEATURE_SYSTEMD
	bool "Enable systemd support"
	default y
	help
	  If you plan to use busybox daemons on a system where daemons
	  are controlled by systemd, enable this option.
	  If you don't use systemd, it is still safe to enable it,
	  but the downside is increased code size.
config FEATURE_RTMINMAX
	bool "Support RTMIN[+n] and RTMAX[-n] signal names"
	default y
	help
	  Support RTMIN[+n] and RTMAX[-n] signal names
	  in kill, killall etc. This costs ~250 bytes.
